<h2 id="the-power-of-the-music"><em><strong>The Power of the music</strong></em></h2>

<p><em>Music is present at every moment of our lives, whether it’s at home, in the car, thanks to a digital music player or during a concert. This art can be found in every culture too, considered as the common passion of the humanity. You don’t need to be a musician to like music, almost everybody like it.  Some melodies make us feeling deep emotions or influence them and it turns out sometimes to be essential for our well-being and is used in some therapy. Even if music persists over the centuries, do we know exactly how our brain processes this information?   We can explain that now thanks to the scientific advance…</em></p>

<p>###But what makes that we like listening to music?</p>

<p>Music makes us happy by acting directly on our brain. This intense pleasure that we feel while we’re listening one of our favorite music generate the secretion of dopamine in our brain. So the secretion depends on our musical culture, the moment of listening…Dopamine is a neurotransmitter (so it transmit the nervous information to the other cells) which compensates the pleasure such as food or addictions (love, sex and drugs).</p>

<p>Researchers of a University of Montreal measured the secretion of dopamine and the activity of the brain on about ten volunteers from 19 to 24 years old. These felt thrills by listening to music. The results published in a scientific journal indicate that music causes well an intense pleasure. The researchers say that their results contribute to explain why music has a so big value in all the human societies, and why she can be effectively used in the rituals, by the marketing or in the movies,… Their experience allows an essential advance on the physical benefits of music.</p>

<p>More generally, it’s difficult to become widespread on the human being, because everybody is different, has a different family background and so a different musical culture. The sounds don’t influence directly the brain, but the spirit does. Indeed, it’s the spirit which is requested by the complex message that music sends back.</p>

<p>During the early years of life, the brain and the way it thinks, it reacts and it behaves, builds itself not only from the visual stimuli and from the family atmosphere, but also according to the sound environment. In this way, the structure of our sound environment will match a particular musical genre. For example, a logical and analytical brain feels right with a music said intellectual, that’s why many mathematicians love Bach, while an intuitive or emotional brain is rather touched by romantic songs…</p>

<p>###How to explain that this attraction for the rhythms and the melodies is shared universally, most probably since the origin of the humanity?</p>

<p>The sound is collected by the ear which is incredibly complex. The ear serves as an interpreter between a sound and the brain and consists of three parts, the external ear, the middle ear and the internal ear, which is an integral part of the brain. Some of these neuronal networks are even exclusively dedicated to the processing of the music, in other words our brain is like a big computer which decrypts the data from the satellites for example. The proof was brought many times by people who, after suffering brain damages, lost the power of speech, while they kept intact their musical brain. Some researches show that the music reduces the activations of the brain regions which are involved in the negative feelings and increase the resistance to the stress. It can allow to face the death with courage or to calm the fears of the babies.</p>

<p>At Harvard, a study was conducted on children who learnt to play an instrument and who practiced every day, the regularity is important, it’s THE condition to establish long-lasting connections between the neurons. A child has the advantage to be a very quick learner, his brain has as many neurons as the brain of an adult but for a child the connections between the neurons (called synapses) are formed more easily than for an adult and in a largest number. The synapses which are used in this case (so the learning of an instrument) are strengthened whereas the others, which are less requested, disappear gradually. Only the children can produce networks of connections so quickly for certain learnings.</p>

<p>At the University of Zurich, researchers also wanted to know if the music makes smarter and if it facilitates the learning of foreign languages for example. The answer is yes! The acoustic comprehension of foreign languages is essentially an auditory phenomenon and we already know that the children who play music and have a well-trained ear, analyze and identify better the sound and the sound stream of a foreign language. Playing an instrument makes thus develops the intellectual abilities but on the condition of playing regularly.</p>

<p>And when we begin at the adulthood? Some adults from 40 to 70 years, who couldn’t play an instrument, began to learn to play the piano during 1 year and tried to practice every day. The researchers measured regularly the electric activity of their brain and compare the results. It’s surprising; 2 months later, the changes are already visible on the electroencephalograms, even for the adults, the brain reacts fast to something new.</p>

<p>###The totally positive effects of the music</p>

<p>Actually, music is used these last years in therapeutic purposes. The music therapy is one of the components of the art-therapy which consists in using the music as a therapeutic tool. It uses the sound and the music in any forms, to restore, maintain or improve the mental, physical and emotional health of a person.</p>

<p>Three years ago, a 56-year-old man had a cerebrovascular accident. His left hemisphere, responsible for the language was damaged. The doctors inform him that there is a little hope that he speaks again one day. During a year and a half his state remains practically the same, until he turns towards the music therapy…</p>

<pre><code>The idea? Singing instead of speaking! The aphasic people (the ones who have an alteration of the function of the language) like singing. Why? They can detect the intonation, the pitch of the sound. And the pitch of the sounds and the melody are elements that we can find in the speech.

The aim of the therapy? If we exercise our musical functions, we also reactivate the language. The rhythm is particularly important. Like the language, it’s also processed in the left hemisphere. The objective is to find the good tempo of the speech by banging on a djembe.

What are the real effects of these exercises on the brain? Two other patients participate in this study; they had a cerebrovascular accident too, and they had serious speech difficulties after this accident. More than a year after their CVA, they always had trouble making themselves understood, in spite of a speech therapy … During 6 months they did sessions of music therapy … All the patients of the study made clear progresses!

Are these progresses visible on a MRI? The patients made a MRI before and after the music therapy. The comparison is eloquent: &quot;We see that before the music therapy, there is an activity center in the right hemisphere, and after the music therapy, it’s contrary to all expectations the left hemisphere”. So the damaged hemisphere regains the control and it’s there that the speech can reform! The patients recover so that he can discuss now!
</code></pre>

<p>Dozens of thousand people lose the power of speech after a cerebrovascular accident; the music therapy could help them to communicate again!</p>

<p>As you can see music is very universal an can have an impact on every little things of our daily life and on diseases too.</p>
